You wake up in your room.

You try to turn off/smash the alarm clock.

The alarm clock is actually your personal assistant robot.

> You didn't understand why she had to sleep in the bed with you.
> She wasn't that kind of robot.
> Samantha tells you -.

Samantha forces you out of the house.
You walk to work.
On the way to work, you meet Joey and Rair, two other humans.
Robots fix you coffee.

You sit down.
Work is boring.

You daydream about getting out.


You walk outside. It smells like cough syrup.
She's pretty hot... but he's more your type.
